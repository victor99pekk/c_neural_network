# c_neural_network
Neural network framework coded in C. Uses the framework I have coded for matrix operations

the network can be implemented with arbitrary amounts of layers and nodes in the layers. The optimizer for the learning rate currently used is Adam.
I try the network a little bit in the main-method where I implement a minimal network to solve the XOR problem.
